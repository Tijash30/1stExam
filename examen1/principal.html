                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
                in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                The next 12 <br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                <br>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br>never written a line of code. I needed <br>some structure from 
                professionals <br>who can help me learn programming <br>step by step. I was encouraged to <br>enroll by a former 
                student of theirs <br>who can only say wonderful things <br>about the program. The entire <br>curriculum and staff 
                did not <br>disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>and I never had to wait long for <br>assistance. The agile team 
                project, in <br>particular, was outstanding. It took <br>my learning to the next level in a way <br>that no tutorial 
                could ever have. In <br>fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br>interviews as an example of my developent 
                experience. It certainly <br>helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>developer after receiving multiple <br>offers. 
                100% recommend! ”

                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
